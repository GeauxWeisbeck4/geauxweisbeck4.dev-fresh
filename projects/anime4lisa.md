# Anime4Lisa

My fiance loves anime, but sometimes she has difficulty deciding which show she wants to watch next because of all the choices out there. That's why I made her this Anime recommendation app using the Anime DB Api.

All she has to do is type in the show she just watched and Anime DB will feed through to the front end of the application and boom - Anime recommendation!
