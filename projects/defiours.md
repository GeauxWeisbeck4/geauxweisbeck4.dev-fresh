# Defi Ours

Defi Ours was an organization I competed in a Hackathon team with in 2022. They asked me to create a website for their project and this was the result. The head of the group, [Isreal Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?fetchDeterministicClustersOnly=true&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXYiYcBf8rA-MXRmaXHo-OofHr0Lfrebwk&keywords=israel%20wilson&origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&position=0&searchId=a61d7465-d733-4064-ba3c-9d68856b7f99&sid=HiD), asked me to find a solid template with a fast static site generator to create the website.

I decided to use one of my favorite SSG's, [Astro](https://astro.build) with a template that made it easy to create a landing page with a blog, an events page, a link to their NFT minting project, and a page that lists their resources.
