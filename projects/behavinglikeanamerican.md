# A behavioral economics, marketing, and business research brand

Behaving Like an American was initially created as a behavioral economics blog using WordPress and a drag and drop site editor. It has evolved into my marketing, psychology, and behavioral economics brand that is still in the early stages of development.

This website was created with 11ty and a starter theme that I used called ["Fernfolio" by Tyler Roderick](https://github.com/TylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template). There are a few ways I am deciding on how to structure this business. I will likely add merchandise, a weekly blog, and whatever other ideas I can come up with.
